1.How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
Ans: As React is on the most popular Front end Library of Javascript . It provides Reauability of components. Easy to read and code architecture. So I decided to choose React as my Front end library for this Assignment.

2.Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Ans: Yes there is nothing perfect. There is always some need of improvement . I can make a API call to other movie databases eg.IMDB for fetching the details of the movies and web shows rather than locally downloaded the JSON. I can even make Authorization Module for the user to login and logout.


3.What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
Ans:If alloted more time i would definitely make a backend using node.js for this Front end where i can just hanlde different routes for login and logout and sending details of the movies and series as per the user interests. I can also use a machine learning based recomendation system at the backend.
